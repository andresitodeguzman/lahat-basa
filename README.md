# All Wet (Purified Drinking Water Station)

## Background
Industries today are migrating towards new technological trends, an example of such is the process automation and computer-based information systems. As the trends in technology increases and develops, business globally needs to be more competitive in order to succeed.

One of the businesses in the industry is All Wet, a purified drinking water station located at 61 Sabang, Dasmarinas City in Cavite, Philippines 4114. Its management and employees are striving to provide the best quality service for their customers. As the world slowly adapts to modernization in the workplace, All Wet remains in using outdated and manual processes for their business-critical sales and inventory requirements. Such method made the workflow not streamlined along with multiple problems that arise like difficulty in handling customer transactions. In their current situation, transactions are made manually and an effective method to monitor supplies doesnâ€™t exist.

This system that would be built aims to improve the workflow and transaction processing of the business. It would also provide customers an easy way to interact with All Wet through their mobile phone and desktop computers.
